# Robotpy-Template
Personally I liked the idea of calling it the "skeleton robot" but this also works, I prob still could but then people would think that it's a weird name so might as well just stick with this one. This template will be used to basically act as a baseline that can have stuff added to it without needing to do complex code fanagaling
